C team project - Stacks and Queues

This project focuses on implementing stacks and queues in C programming language. It provides various opcodes for manipulating the stack and performing operations on its elements.

## Opcodes

### push

The `push` opcode adds an element to the stack.

**Usage:** `push <int>`

- `<int>`: An integer value to be pushed onto the stack.

If `<int>` is not an integer or if no argument is given, the program will print the following error message: "L<line_number>: usage: push integer", followed by a new line. The program will then exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`, where `<line_number>` indicates the line number in the file.

### pall

The `pall` opcode prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top.

**Usage:** `pall`

### pop

The `pop` opcode removes the top element from the stack.

**Usage:** `pop`

If the stack is empty, the program will print the following error message: "L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack", followed by a new line. The program will then exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`, where `<line_number>` indicates the line number in the file.

### swap

The `swap` opcode swaps the top two elements of the stack.

**Usage:** `swap`

If the stack contains less than two elements, the program will print the following error message: "L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short", followed by a new line. The program will then exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`, where `<line_number>` indicates the line number in the file.

### add

The `add` opcode adds the top two elements of the stack.

**Usage:** `add`

If the stack contains less than two elements, the program will print the following error message: "L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short", followed by a new line. The program will then exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`, where `<line_number>` indicates the line number in the file. The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed.

### nop

The `nop` opcode does not perform any action.

**Usage:** `nop`

## Additional Notes

- The program does not handle stack overflows.
- The `atoi` function is used for converting strings to integers.

Feel free to explore and implement these opcodes in your C project. Happy coding!
